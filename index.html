                I've been programming for 6 years now. Developing games and websites and designing them became my passion over the last couple of years. Besides the programming part I love to take portraits and I am very interested in street photography. This website shows my experiences and projects of the latest months and years in webdevelopment and gamedesign. I also show some of my best shots in street photography. Take a look at my little introduction into my personality and life and get in contact with me, if you are interested in talking with me.

                This website is actually an information site for people who are interested in art. Giving a small group of young students having a website and represent their work on it made me quite happy.

            <p id="about_headline">Hi that's me!</p>
            <p id="about_text">I am 19 years old, from Germany and still at school visiting the 13th grade. Since the 5th grade I am very interested in technology and development and started with block development.
            </p>
            <p id="about_text">In the 5th grade I started with developing robots for competitions and learnt the basics of development. For 5 years I have been participating in these competitions. After graduating at that school I stayed there and became the teacher of the programming course. At the moment I teach pupils at the age of 12 to 16 how the world of the computer science works and give them access to the basics but also more advanced techniques of development in python.
            </p>
            <p id="about_text">This woke up different interests in me and I got fascinated about the huge spread and influence of development in all parts of life. My focus went to webdesign and webdevelopment during the latest years. However gamedesign is still a huge part of my creating.</p>
